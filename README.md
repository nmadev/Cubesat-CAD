## Organization

  The two assemblies are listed in the main directory. The difference between these two is explored a bit later in the README. From there I split the non-gravity boom parts into three distinct designations: [Chassis](/Chassis), [Radio Components](/Radio%20Components), and [Other Electronics](/Electronic%20Subsystems). Within Chassis the three folders, [Original Files](/Original%Files), [Edited](/Edited), and [Modified Assembly](/Modified%20Assembly). [Original Files](/Original%Files) contains the original part files recieved from manufacturers. [Edited](/Edited) contains part files that have been modified to more accurately reflect how they will be cut/appear in the final CubeSat. [Modified Assembly](/Modified%20Assembly) has futher modified parts that are used in the modified assembly.

## History of YUAA CubeSat

  Yale CubeSat is currently it's sixth year of continuous work. The objective of the mission is to launch a CubeSat into low-earth orbit and measure proton densities at different points in orbit. Currently, five Yale students are working over the Summer of 2020 remotely to finalize certain hardware and software aspects of the mission including a ground radio station, internal electronic bussing system, gravity boom deployment mechanism, and software integration. The CubeSat will be continually worked on throughout the 2020-2021 school year and the hope is to launch in the Fall of 2021.

## CubeSat Assemblies

  The two assemblies shown below are extremely similar with one large difference: the space alloted for the Cosmic Ray Detector, Magnetometer, and Sun Sensor. The original assembly allows for space near the cover plate for those three components and slightly reduces the vertical space for the gravity boom deployment system. The modified assembly eliminates the space beside the cover plate and adds vertical space for the gravity boom deployment system but also necessitates the placement of the aforementioned three components in the same space as the gravity boom deployment system.
